# BacDive Collaboration Strategy

## Strategic Considerations

### Positioning as Complementary
- Emphasize you're **integrating** their data with other sources, not replacing it
- Highlight that you're **driving traffic** to BacDive (citations, references back)
- Frame it as **value-added services** that enhance their core mission

### Collaboration Opportunities
- Offer to **contribute back** - data quality improvements, mappings, etc.
- Share your **integration challenges** as feedback for their API development
- Propose **joint publications** if your work generates novel insights

### Respectful Boundaries
- Always **cite and acknowledge** BacDive prominently
- Don't duplicate their core functionality (strain pages, search interface)
- Focus on **knowledge graph integration** and **cross-database insights** they don't provide

## The Reality

Most scientific databases are understaffed and overwhelmed. They may appreciate:
- Users who **understand their data model** deeply (you clearly do)
- **Technical feedback** from sophisticated users
- **Reduced support burden** from users who can help themselves

Your approach of being respectful about their time while building valuable integrations seems exactly right. The fact that you've had "nice conversations" is a good sign they see value in the relationship.
