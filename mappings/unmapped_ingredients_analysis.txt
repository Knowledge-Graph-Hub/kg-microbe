# MediaDive Unmapped Ingredients Analysis
# Generated: 2025-12-01 (Updated with Extended MicroMediaParam Mappings)
# Total unmapped: 409 ingredients

## Summary
After upgrading to MicroMediaParam compound_mappings_strict.tsv (1,386 total mappings,
1,153 ontology IDs after filtering), we successfully mapped 786 ingredients to ontologies
(66% of 1,195 total unique ingredients).

**Improvement over basic mapping:**
- **Previous unmapped**: 750 ingredients (37% mapped with basic mapping)
- **Current unmapped**: 409 ingredients (66% mapped with extended mapping)
- **Improvement**: 341 additional mappings = 45% reduction in unmapped ingredients!

The remaining 409 unmapped ingredients represent the most challenging cases that cannot be
easily mapped with current resources. These fall into the following categories:

## Categories of Unmapped Ingredients (from comprehensive review)

### 1. Complex Biological Materials (~30-35%)
Approximately 120-145 ingredients including:
- Beef extract, Meat extract, Yeast extract variants
- Peptone (Bacto peptone, Casein peptone, Tryptone, etc.)
- Blood products, Serum (bovine, fetal, etc.)
- Tissue extracts, Organ homogenates
- Natural product extracts (plant, microbial)
- Hydrolyzed proteins

**Examples from data:**
- Bacto Tryptone, Bacto Panton, Bacto Bitone
- Beef extract, Meat extract, Yeast extract
- Blood (various types), Serum

**Challenge**: These are complex mixtures without single chemical identities. Many are proprietary
formulations (Bacto, Difco brands) with variable composition.

### 2. Specialized/Proprietary Media Components (~15-20%)
Approximately 60-80 ingredients including:
- Growth factor supplements
- Vitamin mixtures (multi-vitamin solutions)
- Trace element solutions (custom mixtures)
- Commercial media supplements
- Brand-specific formulations

**Examples from data:**
- Trace elements solution
- Vitamin mixture
- Growth factor supplements
- Mineral salt solutions

**Challenge**: Often proprietary mixtures or custom formulations specific to research labs.
Composition may not be standardized or publicly documented.

### 3. Chemical Compounds with Non-Standard Nomenclature (~25-30%)
Approximately 100-125 ingredients including:
- Non-IUPAC naming conventions
- Uncommon synonym variations
- Formula notations not in mapping table
- Chemical name typos or abbreviations
- Vendor-specific compound names

**Examples from data:**
- "4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid" (HEPES variant spelling)
- "2-N-Morpholinoethanesulfonic acid" (MES variant)
- "Al2SO43 x 18 H2O" (non-standard notation)
- "2-chloro-4ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine" (missing hyphen)

**Challenge**: Name variants and non-standard notations that differ from ChEBI preferred names.
Some may be typos in source data. Manual curation or fuzzy matching could help.

### 4. Rare or Specialized Chemicals (~10-15%)
Approximately 40-60 ingredients including:
- Less common organic acids
- Specialized buffers (research-grade)
- Novel synthetic compounds
- Rare minerals or salts
- Research chemicals not yet in ChEBI

**Challenge**: May not be well-represented in ontologies. Some may be recent synthetic compounds
or highly specialized research chemicals.

### 5. Media Formulations and Solutions (~8-12%)
Approximately 30-50 ingredients including:
- Pre-mixed solutions (e.g., "84 g/L NaHCO3 solution")
- Basal media components (e.g., "Basal mineral NaCl medium")
- Stock solutions
- Buffer systems

**Examples from data:**
- "84 g/L NaHCO3 solution"
- "Basal mineral NaCl medium"
- "Basal salts solution"

**Challenge**: These are formulations or mixtures, not single chemical entities. Should potentially
be modeled as solutions rather than compounds.

### 6. Missing/Empty Names (~0.2%)
Approximately 1 ingredient:
- Ingredients with no name provided
- Placeholder entries in source data

**Challenge**: Cannot be mapped without a name. Requires investigation of source data.

### 7. Other (~5-8%)
Approximately 20-30 ingredients including:
- Generic terms (e.g., "Air")
- Deprecated compound names
- Ambiguous entries
- Data quality issues

## Recommendations for Future Mapping Improvements

### High Priority:
1. **Add synonym/alias mappings** for common biological materials
   - Create mappings for common peptone, extract, and supplement brands
   - Include vendor-specific product names

2. **Normalize chemical nomenclature** (IUPAC vs common names)
   - Fuzzy string matching to handle typos and minor spelling variations
   - Handle different hydrate notations (x, ·, •, ×)
   - Normalize whitespace and punctuation

3. **ChEBI name search integration**
   - Use ChEBI API or SPARQL to search for name variants
   - Implement synonym expansion for common chemicals

### Medium Priority:
4. **Create mappings for proprietary products** where possible
   - Contact vendors for composition data
   - Use published literature for formulations

5. **Consider custom ontology** for complex biological materials
   - Model peptones, extracts, and supplements with their own terms
   - Link to component chemicals where known

### Low Priority:
6. **Manual curation** of remaining difficult cases
   - Review and correct typos in source data
   - Add custom mappings for research-specific chemicals

7. **Solution/mixture modeling**
   - Model pre-mixed solutions as separate entities
   - Link to component chemicals with concentrations

- Transform output: `data/transformed/mediadive/nodes.tsv`

## Extended Mapping Statistics
- **Mapping file**: compound_mappings_strict.tsv
- **Total entries**: 1,386 compound mappings
- **Ontology IDs**: 1,153 (after filtering out custom prefixes)
- **Coverage**: 66% of 1,195 unique MediaDive ingredients
- **Unmapped**: 409 ingredients (34%)

## Impact Assessment
The extended mapping represents a significant improvement:
- **341 additional successful mappings** (750 → 409 unmapped)
- **45% reduction** in unmapped ingredients
- **29% absolute improvement** in coverage (37% → 66%)

The remaining 409 unmapped ingredients represent genuinely difficult cases that require:
- Manual curation
- New ontology terms
- Enhanced name matching algorithms
- Better source data quality
