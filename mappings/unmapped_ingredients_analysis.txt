# MediaDive Unmapped Ingredients Analysis
# Generated: 2025-12-01
# Total unmapped: 750 ingredients

## Summary
After upgrading to MicroMediaParam compound_name_lookup.tsv (813 mappings),
we successfully mapped 445 ingredients to ontologies (37% of 1,195 total).

The remaining 750 unmapped ingredients fall into these categories:

## Categories of Unmapped Ingredients (from sample review)

### 1. Complex Biological Materials (~30%)
- Beef extract, Meat extract, Yeast extract variants
- Peptone (Bacto peptone, Casein peptone, etc.)
- Blood products, Serum, Tissue extracts
- Natural product extracts

### 2. Specialized/Proprietary Media Components (~20%)
- Growth factor supplements
- Vitamin mixtures
- Trace element solutions
- Commercial media supplements

### 3. Chemical Compounds with Name Variants (~25%)
- Different naming conventions
- Synonym variations
- Chemical formula notations not in mapping table
- Example: "4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid" (HEPES variant)

### 4. Rare or Specialized Chemicals (~15%)
- Less common organic acids
- Specialized buffers
- Research-grade chemicals
- Novel or synthetic compounds

### 5. Missing/Empty Names (~5%)
- Ingredients with no name provided
- Placeholder entries

### 6. Other (~5%)
- Mixtures
- Custom formulations
- Deprecated compound names

## Recommendations for Future Mapping Improvements

1. **Add synonym/alias mappings** for common biological materials
2. **Normalize chemical nomenclature** (IUPAC vs common names)
3. **Create mappings for proprietary products** where possible
4. **Use ChEBI name search** to find additional mappings
5. **Consider creating custom ontology** for complex biological materials
